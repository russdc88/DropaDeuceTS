						<p class="bio">My name is Russ Christensen. I currently reside in South Jordan, Utah with my wife and little girl. I love everything to do with tennis. From playing the sport to being involved in the tennis community in Salt Lake City. I've been playing tennis for 20 years, 15 of which I've been stringing racquets. I played Division one tennis for a University before graduating with a degree in Mathematics. I can provide services on the strategic and analytics of the game!</p>

						<p class="bio">My goal as a Racquet Technician is to provide the best service to any individual with a racquet with the best prices, from stringing the racquet to consulting on best options and prices for a racquet. </p>

							<h3 id="services">Stringing & Racquet Customization</h3>
							<p>In the last 15 years of playing tennis, the biggest frustations I dealt with was how often I broke tennis strings and how much they cost to string. I want to solve that for others. We have over an assortment of strings that will fit your style for play, for half the price a club would charge. Whether you want to add extra bite to that topspin, get more power in your shot, or just something to help your tennis elbow, we have it all. </p>

							<p>Maybe you are looking for a little bit of power or mobility from your racquet without paying $200 for a new racquet. We do customizations to racquets to add that extra X factor to your game.</p> 

							<p>Price: Varies on string and customization. Call or text me at (435)-862-2423 for a quote.</p>

							<h3>Match Play Experience</h3>
							<p>If you want to win matches, you need to play more matches and learn how to win those matches. While playing College tennis, I had to learn quickly how to exploit my opponent and find their weaknesses. I provide a match experience that is worth more than the price I am offering. Not only do we hit and play a match, we will go in depth on strategy and how to find these weaknesses from our opponent. We will also have video to record the match and statistics in that match to better analyze performance. </p>

							<p>Price: $20/hr</p>

										<h3>Racquet Consulting/Buying</h3>
										<p>When shopping for a racquet, our first option is to go to a club and ask. The problem with that is clubs are sponsored by specific tennis racquet brands, so they are going to try to sell you those racquets, in which they will raise the price to make money. I want to widen that scope at a more affordable price. I provide an in depth analysis on what racquet will fit you best based on a series of questions. I will then shop the market at both clubs and websites within your budget and find demo racquets for you to test.</p>

										<p>Price: 8% commission of racquet price. Call or text me at (435)-862-2423 for additional questions. </p>
